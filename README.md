# System-Analysis-and-Design

  The DriverPass project was for a company called DriverPass who wanted to create a cloud applicatioin that where the goal was to help people with learner's permits gain experience and feedback with the intention of being able to pass their driver's exam and get their license. What I think I did well was address their needs and find what would work best for them while still including eveyrthing that they needed. I wanted to think of it from the perspective of how the client would look at and interact with the system. If I had to choose one part to revise it would be some of my UML designs. As, especially with the UML Class diagram, I felt like more could have been addded to each of the objects classes but couldn't really tell what was missing, or how adding one thing would interact with another class. When I look at the users needs I look at it from how they would use it or how they think the client would use it. This is a system for them so I want to make sure it has eveythign that they wanted and then some. In the future I would try to get more information as to what will actually make up the system, this ties in to what I would have wanted to improve if I could re-do parts of it.
